Findings:
2d structure:
2 types of tesselations, regular and semi regular. Regular tesselations are made of a single repeating unit while semi-regular tesselations are made of 2 or more repeating units.
Regular tesselations can only be made of polygons with internal angles that are integer dividers of 360 degrees. Mathematically, 360 ≅ 0 (mod (n-2)*180/n) 
Only three unit shapes possible for regular tesselation, triangles, squares and hexagons.
polygons with 5 fold symmetry cannot regularly tesselate as internal angles of such polygon is 108 degrees, not an integer diviser of 360.

Higher dimensional structure:
Angle between two vectors θ in higher dimensions is defined by the dot product: a · b = |a| × |b| × cos(θ)
internal angles of units in crystal must add to 360 degrees when resolved in all dimensions
For a regular structure with the repetition of a single unit crystal must observe translational symmetry, where repeating units are translated in n dimensions to form the entire crystal.
A regular polygon in the nth dimesion must have faces that are regular polygons of the (n-1)th dimesion, as well as equal angles between verticies.

Quasicrystals:
Quasicrystals have an orderly structure but lack translational symmetry dissimilar to regular crystals
Crystal structure has long-range order with predictable arrangements of units across the entire crystalline structure but repetition of units is not periodic
Diffraction analysis of quasicrystals reveal that individual units are 4-dimensional(???)
